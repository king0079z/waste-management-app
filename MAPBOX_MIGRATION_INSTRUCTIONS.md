## 🔒 Security Note

**Your Mapbox token is public** - it's meant to be in client-side code. Mapbox protects your account with:
- URL restrictions (optional)
- Rate limiting
- Free tier limits
- You can rotate/revoke tokens anytime

**It's completely safe to use in your HTML!**

## 💡 Alternative: Use Temporary Demo Token

If you want to test first before signing up, I can use Mapbox's demo token, but it has stricter limits. Better to get your own free token!
