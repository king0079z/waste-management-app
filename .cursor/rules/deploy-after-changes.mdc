# Deploy workflow: local + GitHub

Whenever you modify any project files (code, config, or docs) in this repo:

1. **Local**: Edits are already applied in the workspace.
2. **GitHub**: Before finishing your response, run:
   - `git add` the changed files (or `git add -A` for all)
   - `git commit -m "Brief description of the change"`
   - `git push origin main`

Use PowerShell-compatible commands (e.g. `Set-Location "path"; git add ...` — no `&&`).

This keeps the repo on GitHub in sync so the user can redeploy directly on Render (auto-deploy from `main` or manual deploy).

**Exception**: Do not commit secrets, `.env`, or files listed in `.gitignore`. Only commit safe project files.
