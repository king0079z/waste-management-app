# ✅ Mapbox Fleet Map - Final Configuration

## What I've Updated

### 1. **Removed Bins from Fleet Map** ✅
- Fleet map now shows ONLY vehicles/drivers
- Bins removed from fleet visualization
- Focus on fleet management, not waste collection points

### 2. **Automatic Initialization** ✅
- No console commands needed!
- Auto-initializes when you visit Fleet Management page
- Tries 3 times to ensure it loads (1s, 3s, 5s delays)
- Works automatically after reload

### 3. **Fleet Page Only** ✅
- Mapbox ONLY replaces the fleet management map
- Main monitoring page still uses Leaflet (keeps all your bins visible there)
- Clean separation between fleet tracking and waste monitoring

---

## 🚀 RELOAD NOW (Final Time)

```
Ctrl + Shift + R
```

Then:
1. Click **"Fleet"** in main navigation (left sidebar)
2. The map will **automatically load** with Mapbox
3. You'll see **ONLY vehicles/drivers** (no bins)
