                    🚨 CRITICAL: CLEAR YOUR BROWSER CACHE 🚨
===============================================================================

The popup fix code (v3.0) is NOT loading because your browser is caching old JavaScript files.

⚡ STEPS TO FIX (DO ALL OF THESE):

1. CLOSE ALL BROWSER TABS of the application

2. CLEAR BROWSER CACHE:
   Windows: Press Ctrl + Shift + Delete
   - Select "Cached images and files"
   - Click "Clear data"

3. RESTART THE SERVER:
   - Stop the server (Ctrl + C)
   - Run: npm start (or start-app.bat)

4. OPEN IN INCOGNITO/PRIVATE MODE:
   Windows: Ctrl + Shift + N (Chrome/Edge)
   - This bypasses all cache
   - Type: http://localhost:3000

5. VERIFY THE FIX IS LOADED:
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Look for this message in GREEN:
     🗺️ MAP MANAGER v3.0 LOADED - ULTRA POPUP PROTECTION
   
   - If you DON'T see v3.0, the cache is still not cleared!

6. TEST THE BIN POPUP:
   - Click any bin marker
   - You should see COLORED console logs:
     🖱️ CLICKING BIN BIN-XXX (purple background)
     🔓 BIN POPUP OPENED (green background)
   - Popup should STAY OPEN
   - You should be able to click buttons

===============================================================================
                        WHAT I CHANGED (v3.0):
===============================================================================

✅ Blocked ALL map click events from closing popups
✅ Override popup _close() method to prevent automatic closing
✅ Lock popup open for 2-3 seconds after opening
✅ Block all mouse/touch events on the map
✅ Popup can ONLY close by clicking the X button
✅ Added cache-busting to JavaScript files (?v=3.0.1)

===============================================================================
                IF POPUP STILL CLOSES AFTER CACHE CLEAR:
===============================================================================

Please share EXACTLY what you see in the console when you click a bin.
I need to see if these messages appear:
- 🗺️ MAP MANAGER v3.0 LOADED
- 🖱️ CLICKING BIN
- 🔓 BIN POPUP OPENED
- 🔒 BIN POPUP CLOSED

If you don't see the v3.0 banner, THE CODE IS NOT LOADED YET.
